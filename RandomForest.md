# Random Forest
Most commonly used and are know by the robustness. A **random forest** is an ensemble model (a compression of other models
and take prediction of each model to form an overall prediction) consisting of many Decision Trees working together across different randomly selected subsets
of data, facilitating improved accuracy and stability

In case of random forest the prediction models are *decision trees:* aplits data into distinct buckets using input variables, with split decisions
being based on how well each potential split explains differences in output variable. Weaker models are grouped to get a stronger model.
