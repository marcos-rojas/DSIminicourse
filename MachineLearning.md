# Introduction to Machine Learning
Algorithms that learn from data, then apply those learning to make informed decision/predictions on new data
Some other terms definitions:
- AI: programming of machines to mimic cognitive functions in humans
- Deep Learning: subset of ML algorithms which often utilize multilayered Neural Networks to understand abstranct/unstructured patterns
- Data Science: Broad field that encompases: CS, Stats, Analytics or AI

Most of the time, machine learning is divided into:
- **Supervised learning:** have input and output/label, we need to learn the model of mapping (set of rules). When
  get new data, we can predict an output applying the model we've learn. There are two types of outputs: *regresion*: label
  is numerical (a single value) and *classification:* predict which group or class a data point will be (Yes/No, Safe/Unsafe, Groups)
- **Unsupervised learning:** data is unlabeled and the goal is find structures within data. One common task is clustering (look
  to separate dataset based on similarity among data points), customer segmentation. Another common task is association ruler,
  customer also bought (like in recommendation).
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
